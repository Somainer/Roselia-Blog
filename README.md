# Roselia-Blog

Roselia-Blog is a blog engine. Its front-end is mostly written in TypeScript and Vue, while its back-end is written in Python.

English | [简体中文](./README-CN.md)

## Usage
These are steps you should take after cloning this repo.

### Prerequisite
* `Python 3.6+` (because of string interpolations).
* `NodeJS`  (to compile the front-end).
* `Yarn pkg` The package manager for NodeJS.

Then install the dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Then change current work dir to `./frontend` and execute `yarn`.

### Configuration
There are three configs you need to change based on your conditions.
In general, you do not need to change configs with a default value except blog title, motto and link.

In `api_server/config.py` you could change:
* `BLOG_LINK`: The link to your blog webpage.
* `BLOG_INFO`: Change title, motto as you like. (For server-side static page rendering.)
* `DEBUG`: Make sure it is `False` if you want to run it in production.
* `ANTI_SEO`: Disable SEO optimization if this is `True`. If so, contents won’t be rendered per user request. Note that spiders which might execute user JavaScript like Google may also get the content.
* `HOST`: The listening host, default `0.0.0.0`.
* `PORT`: The listening port, default 5000.
* `DB_PATH`: The database address,can be SQL addresses.
* `UPLOAD_DIR`: The image upload directory. Make it empty to disable directly upload images to this server.

In `api_server/secret.py` you could change:
* `APP_KEY` & `APP_SALT`: The application key and salt for token generation. Change it to `gen_key()` to generate a random key every launch, or change it to a custom `str` value.
* `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` & `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`: the id and secret for GitHub OAuth, keep it empty to disable it.
* `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_ID` & `MICROSOFT_CLIENT_SECRET`: the id and secret for MSA OAuth, keep it empty to disable it.
* `CHEVERETO_API_KEY` & `CHEVERETO_API_ENDPOINT`: the api enpoint and key for uploading images to the chevereto service. Keep them empty to disable this upload channel.
* `SM_MS_API_TOKEN`: The api token to upload images to `sm.ms` image hosting server. Keep it empty to disable this channel.

In `frontend/src/common/config.js`, you could change (in bottom `export default` clause):
* `title`: The title of blog.
* `motto`: The motto of blog.
* `apiBase`: The api base URL of the site, default `/api`.
* `theme`: The theme of the blog.
* `enableRoseliaScript`: Control whether enable the in post rendering JavaScript.
* `enableAskYukina`: Control whether enable the assistant. Please make it false because this function is still under development.
* `footName`: The string display in the footer.
* `urlPrefix`: Change the prefixing URL of the blog, default is an empty string.
* `images.indexBannerImage`: The banner image of index page.
* `images.lazyloadImage`: The placeholder image of images in the post.
* `images.timelineBannerImage`: The banner image of timeline page.

Basically, you only need to change title and motto and footName.

### Build
After installing all dependencies, you just execute `api_server/roselia.py build` to build the front-end.

### Start
Just execute `api_server/roselia.py serve` to start the server.
Then, configure the nginx or apache.
After that, access the blog index, follow the instructions, you are all done.

### About `api_server/roselia.py`
`roselia.py` provided some commands to start or build the blog. Usage: `roselia.py [command]`
command could be:
> * serve: Start the service regarding `DEBUG` setting.
> * run-dev: Force start the development environment.
> * run-prod: Force start the production environment.
> * run-gunicorn: Start the server using `gunicorn`.
> * compress-assets: **Remove previous static folder**,.copy static_assets` to `static`, and compress images.
> * copy-assets Copy **built** front-end assets to static, then replace CSS and JS in templates.
> * build-frontend Build the front end.
> * build = compress-assets + build-front-end + copy-assets
> * assets = compress-assets + copy-assets

## Features
If you are writing codes or formulas in articles, this blog is suitable for you because this blog has native, out-of-the-box support of following functions:
* Code highlighting.
* Formula
* Side-bar navigation.
* Preview of links to articles.
* References skip and preview.
* In-article JavaScript and string interpolation, for additional functions or provide support for comments.
* Block text template syntax for to humorously blocking out “inappropriate” or “secret” text. They are texts surrounded by `~`.
* Paste or drop to upload images.
* Paste code snippets directly from `Visual Studio Code`.
* Hidden Posts: posts which could only be accessed via permanent link.
* Secret Posts: posts which users with a certain role level only could access.
* Social login: user could login via GitHub or Microsoft accounts.
* Two factor authentication.

## Roselia Script
Roselia-Blog does not open for registration, hence, we fully trust every user in this site. So, we open the in-post or comment script to all users. This script could interpolate strings, open/close some switches, or programmatically change the metadata of post or comment. It is still dangerous because `while (true) {}` will still crash the browser. So, you could disable it in the config.

Syntax: `<prefix>{{<expression>}}`

The `<prefix>` is anything matches `Roselia|roselia|r|R`.  The `<expression>` is a valid `JavaScript` expression.
If this expression ends with comma(`;`), this expression is treated as a clause and the execution result will be dropped.

Example: `r{{ 1 + 1 }}` renderes to `2`.

There are such built-in apis:
* `def (name: string, func: any)` naming a result. This result is possible to be used in following scripts or comments.
* `onceLoad (fn: () => void)` Add a callabck when post is loaded.
* `onceUnload(fn: () => void)` Add a callback when post is destroyed.
* `getElement (name: RSElementSelector): HTMLElement | null`: Get the HTML element by id or other api rendering result. 
* `element (name: RSElementSelector): Promise<HTMLElement>`: Promise version of `getElement`.
* `then (f: () => void)`: Add a callback when the DOM is loaded.
* `music (meta: MusicMetaObject | MusicMetaObject[], autoplay = false, onPlayerReady?: (ob?: object) => void)`: Insert a music or musics (based on APlayer).
* `btn (text: string, onClick?: () => void, externalClasses: Array<String>|String = ‘’, externalAttributes?: object)`: Insert a button.
* `toast(text: string, color: string)` Display a notification.
* `importJS (url: string, onComplete?: any)`: Insert a JavaScript from other source. (May affect articles afterwards)
* `
createElement<K extends keyof HTMLElementTagNameMap>(
    type: K,
    extend?: RecursivePartial<HTMLElementTagNameMap[K]>,
    children?: (Node | string)[]
): HTMLElementTagNameMap[K]
`: Create the element with type `type`, extend the attributed in `extent`, finally, fill the children.
* `createTextNode(text: string): Text`: Create a text node.
* `currentTheme()`: Get current theme palette.
* `changeThemeOnce(theme: Partial<typeof config.theme>): void`: Change the theme when viewing this post, reset theme when switching posts.
* `changeTheme(theme: Partial<typeof config.theme>): void`: Change the theme until refresh. (Asks for `theme` priviledge).
* `resetTheme()`: Reset the theme to default.
* `saveCurrentTheme()`: Save current theme.
* `switchToColorMode(isLight: boolean)`: Change the color mode. To light mode if isLight is true, otherwise dark mode. Reset after post is destroyed.
* `async forceSwitchToColorMode(light: boolean)`: Change the color mode. Won’t change until refresh.
* `changeExtraDisplaySettings(settings: Partial<{
    metaBelowImage: boolean,
    blurMainImage: boolean,
    disableSideNavigation: boolean
  }>)`: Change the extra display settings. `metaBelowImage` controls whether the metadata of post is below the image.
`blurMainImage` controls if blur the dominant image. `disableSideNavigation` controls whether disable the side navigation.
* `sendNotification(notification: INotification)`: Send a notification to user (via the global notification bus).
* `hyperScript` is a convenient shortcut for creating elements without passing children as array. Also, HTML tags can also be used as an attribute to be element creaters. In most cases, we aliasing this value as `h` to make our code shorter via `def('h', hyperScript)`;
Example: 
```JavaScript
defState('userName', ''),
hyperScript.div(
    hyperScript.h1('Hello', ' ', 'World!'),
    hyperScript.span({
        className: 'heimu'
    }, 'This content is hidden.'),
    'Who are you?',
    hyperScript('input', {
        value: userName,
        onInput() {
            userName = this.value;
        }
    }),
    hyperScript('button', {
        onClick() {
            userName = '';
            toast('Submitted!', 'success')
        }
    }, 'Submit')
)
```

### Hooks
Roselia-Script supports react-like hooks, which is inspired both by Vue and React.
There are several APIs help building reactive posts.
APIs introducing new variables are prefixed with `def`. Hook APIs are prefixed with `use`. So, we have following APIs:

#### defState
```typescript
declare function defState<S>(name: string, state: S | (() => S)): void
```
`defState` accepts a name and a state, introducing that variable to current article. 
Basically, you could write a simplest counter in this way:
```
r{{
    defState('count', 0), btn(count, () => ++count)
}}
```
This would introduce a button, displaying current count, increasing count every click.

#### useState
Somebody would miss the legacy `useState` hook in React. Here is `useState`.
This hook is expected to hehave the same as [React State Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html).

```typescript
declare function useState<S>(state: S | (() => S)): [S, (value: (S | ((oldValue: S) => S))) => void]
```

A counter could be written as:
```javascript
(() => {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
    return btn(count, () => setCount(c => c + 1))
})()
```
Or:
```javascript
    def(['count', 'setCount'], useState(0)), btn(count, () => setCount(c => c + 1))
```

`defState` is more reactive and short while `useState` is more functional. If you loved Vue, you might be happy with `defState`, otherwise use `useState`.

#### useEffect
This hook is expected to behave the same as [React Effect Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html).
```typescript
declare function useEffect(effect: () => void, deps: any[]): void
```

#### useInterval / useTimeout
```typescript
declare function useInterval(callback: () => void, interval: number | null): void
```
Both hook have the same signature. Interval could be changed when `interval` changed. 
If `interval` is `null`, the interval stopped.
Here is an implementation to demonstrate how it works:
```typescript
function useInterval(callback: () => void, interval: number | null): void {
    useEffect(() => {
        if (typeof interval === 'number') {
            const timer = setInterval(() => fn(), interval)
            return () => clearInterval(timer)
        }
    }, [interval])
}
```

#### useReactiveState
```typescript
declare function useReactiveState<S extends object>(init: S | (() => S)): S;
```

This hook takes an initial state, then returns a reactive proxy (not recursively listened). Then `Roselia-Script` will listen to its property changes, each change will cause a refresh. Since it is not deeply listened, make sure to mutate the value in the first layer.

#### useMemo / useCallback
```typescript
declare function useMemo<S>(compute: () => S, deps: any[] = []): S;
function useCallback(callback: () => void, deps: any[]) {
    return useMemo(() => callback, deps)
}
```
`useMemo` prevents duplicate computing of time-intensive works. It takes the computing function which takes no argument and produces the value. This value will be memorized each call until elements of `deps` changes.

#### Contexts
```typescript
interface IRoseliaScriptContext<T> {
    Provider: (props: { value: T }) => RoseliaVNode
}
declare function createContext<T>(defaultValue: T): IRoseliaScriptContext<T>;

declare function useContext<T>(context: IRoseliaScriptContext<T>): T;
```

To use context, first you should create a context, then render a context provider component just like what `React` does.
In contrast, we do not have a consumer and function as props in `Roselia-Script`,
instead we use just `useContext` hook.
`useContext` hook takes a context (**not its provider**), and returns the contextual value, if not context found, the default value will be produced.

```typescript
const ThemeContext = createContext(null);
const ThemedButton = ({text}) => {
    const theme = useContext(ThemeContext)
    return hyperScript.button({
        style: {
            background: theme.primary
        },
    }, text)
}
const App = () => {
    return hyperScript(
        ThemeContext.Provider, 
        {
            value: {
                primary: '#6670ed'
            }
        },
        hyperScript(ThemedButton, {
            text: 'Themed Button'
        })
    )
}
```

### Roselia-Dom

There are two different procedures when processing in-article scripts. They are:

1. Rendering

   Rendering relaces all scripts to its execution result as a single HTML
   string, then releace the post with this single HTML string. Whenever a state changed, the content will be re-rendered and all contents of this
   article will be replaced. This procedure is not so efficient during frequent state changes. This is the default processing method for articles
   and comments. 

2. Mounting

    This method compiles the article to a function yielding a virtual dom, just as popular MVVM frameworks. A new virtual dom will be generated
    everytime a state changed. After that, this virtual dom will be compared
    with old virtual dom via a reconciliation algorithm by diffing both doms,
    generating a patch, which actually changes the dom and this action is async. This procedure will not be so effcient if no state is going to be changed. This method is only
    available when rendering an article, to use this metod, you should add such content on the first line of article:

        ---feature:roselia-dom---
    
    This function is experimental and way of activiation may be changed.


### Examples:

Inserting a song:

```
r{{
    music({
       title: ‘陽だまりロードナイト’,
        author: ‘Roselia’,
        url: ‘https://cdn.roselia.moe/static/img/roselia/hidamari.mp3’,
        pic: ‘https://p4.music.126.net/gT4F8nlV2Io58GTVAEWyLw==/18636722092789001.jpg’
    })
}}
```

When the script is executed in posts, a special variable `post` will be available in the context.
Properties of this object can be modified to change the metadata during runtime. Also, a `comment` variable will be available when rendering comments.
